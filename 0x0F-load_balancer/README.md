# Load Balancer Automation Project

This project aims to automate the setup of a load balancer and redundant web servers in a web stack infrastructure. It's designed for DevOps engineers, SysAdmins, or anyone interested in improving the scalability and reliability of web applications by implementing load balancing techniques.










#Overview

In this project, we aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of a web stack infrastructure by introducing redundancy for web servers through load balancing. By doubling the number of web servers and configuring them behind a load balancer, we ensure that the system can handle increased traffic while maintaining high availability. This project is ideal for individuals interested in DevOps, SysAdmin, or web infrastructure management, as it covers essential concepts of load balancing and automation using Bash scripting.
