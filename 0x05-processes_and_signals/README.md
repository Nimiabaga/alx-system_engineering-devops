# Processes and Signals Project

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding processes and signals in a Linux environment using Bash scripting. The main objective is to create a Bash script that displays its own PID (Process ID). The script will be named `0-what-is-my-pid`.

## Scripts

### 0-what-is-my-pid

This script displays its own PID.

**Usage:**
```bash
./0-what-is-my-pid
alx-system_engineering-devops
└── 0x05-processes_and_signals
    ├── 0-what-is-my-pid
    │   └── 0-what-is-my-pid  # Bash script
