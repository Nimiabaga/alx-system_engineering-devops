Web Stack Debugging #0
Overview
This project is part of the Web Stack Debugging series, aimed at training in the art of debugging web stacks. The goal is to fix broken or bugged web stacks using Bash scripting.

Description
In this task, the objective is to fix an issue with an Apache web server running inside a Docker container. The server should return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when queried at its root.

Instructions
Start the Docker container with port mapping: docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
Access the container: docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
Check if Apache is running: service apache2 status
If Apache is not running, start it: service apache2 start
Ensure that the default Apache page exists and contains the correct content: echo "Hello Holberton" > /var/www/html/index.html
Test by querying the root of the server using curl: curl 0:8080
