0x0E. Web Stack Debugging #1
Description
This project is part of the Holberton School's Web Stack Debugging series. In this project, we focus on debugging Nginx configuration issues to ensure that it listens on port 80 of all active IPv4 IPs.

Tasks
0-nginx_likes_port_80:
Using debugging skills, find out what’s preventing the Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Write a Bash script to automate the fix, ensuring Nginx is running and listening on port 80 of all active IPv4 IPs.
Requirements
All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
All files should end with a newline.
All Bash script files must be executable.
Scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error.
Scripts must run without error.
The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash.
The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does.
Usage
To run the Bash script for each task, execute it in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
./script_name
Replace script_name with the name of the Bash script you want to execute.
