Puppet Configuration Management Project
Overview
This project aims to implement Puppet configuration management for automating infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and maintenance. Puppet will help ensure consistency across servers and reduce the risk of incidents similar to the one experienced with the Skynet auto-remediation tool at SlideShare.

Background Context
During my time at SlideShare, I encountered an incident where a bug in the auto-remediation tool caused significant disruption to the infrastructure. Thanks to Puppet, we were able to restore normal operation swiftly, highlighting the importance of configuration management in maintaining a stable and reliable infrastructure.
