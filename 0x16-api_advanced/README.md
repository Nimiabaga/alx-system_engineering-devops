# Reddit API Practice Project

This project provides practice in utilizing the Reddit API to perform various tasks, such as querying endpoints, handling pagination, parsing JSON results, making recursive API calls, and sorting dictionaries by value. It's ideal for individuals looking to enhance their skills in API usage, particularly for technical interviews or real-world scenarios involving data retrieval and manipulation.



## Learning Objectives


By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Read API documentation to identify the desired endpoints.
Utilize APIs with pagination to retrieve large datasets.
Parse JSON responses obtained from API requests.
Implement recursive API calls for iterative data retrieval.
Sort dictionaries by their values.

## Requirements

General
Editors: You can use vi, vim, or emacs for coding.
Environment: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
File Endings: Ensure all files end with a newline character.
Shebang Line: The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
Library Imports: Organize imported libraries alphabetically.
README.md: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
PEP 8 Style: Follow the PEP 8 style guide for writing Python code.
Executable Files: All files must be executable.
File Length: File length will be tested using wc.
Module Documentation: Each module should have documentation accessible via python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'.
Requests Module: Utilize the Requests module for HTTP requests to the Reddit API.
